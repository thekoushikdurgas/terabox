- Platform-specific browser handling
- Extensible design for new browser support

### 4. Repository Pattern

**Location**: `utils/terabox_official_api.py`

- Encapsulation of data access logic
- Consistent interface for different API operations
- Separation of business logic from data access

### 5. State Pattern

**Location**: `utils/state_manager.py`

- Efficient state management without UI reruns
- Batch state updates for performance
- Consistent state handling across components

### 6. Observer Pattern

**Location**: Progress tracking throughout the application

- Progress callbacks for download operations
- UI updates based on operation status
- Decoupled progress monitoring

## üîç Debug Logging Examples

### API Operations

```python
# RapidAPI file info request
2025-09-19 14:30:15 | teradl.rapidapi | INFO | get_file_info:285 | Starting file extraction - URL: https://terabox.com/s/example...
2025-09-19 14:30:15 | teradl.rapidapi | INFO | get_file_info:295 | Normalized URL: https://www.terabox.app/sharing/link?surl=example
2025-09-19 14:30:16 | teradl.rapidapi | INFO | get_file_info:324 | RapidAPI file info request completed in 1.2s
2025-09-19 14:30:16 | teradl.rapidapi | INFO | get_file_info:325 | Successfully extracted file info: example.mp4
```

### Cache Operations

```python
# Cache hit scenario
2025-09-19 14:31:20 | teradl.cache | INFO | get_cached_response:138 | Cache hit for surl: example - File: teraboxlink_example.json
2025-09-19 14:31:20 | teradl.cache | INFO | get_cached_response:145 | Response served from cache - Age: 2.3 hours

# Cache miss scenario
2025-09-19 14:32:10 | teradl.cache | INFO | get_cached_response:121 | No cache file found for surl: newfile
2025-09-19 14:32:12 | teradl.cache | INFO | save_response_to_cache:194 | Cached response for surl: newfile - File: teraboxlink_newfile.json
```

### Error Handling

```python
# Network error with retry
2025-09-19 14:33:05 | teradl.core | ERROR | _make_request:335 | Connection error (attempt 1/4)
2025-09-19 14:33:05 | teradl.core | INFO | _make_request:291 | Retry delay calculation - Base: 1.0s, Jitter: 0.3s, Total: 1.3s
2025-09-19 14:33:07 | teradl.core | INFO | _make_request:325 | Request successful - Status: 200, Size: 1024 bytes
```
