### Uploading

To upload a file, use the instance of TeraboxUploader and specify the file path.

#### Example: Save File to a Specific Directory

```javascript

async function uploadFile() {
  try {
    const result = await uploader.uploadFile(
      filePath,
      showProgress,
      "/myUploads"
    );
    if (result.success) {
      console.log("File uploaded successfully!");
      console.log("File details:", result.fileDetails);
    } else {
      console.log("Upload failed:", result.message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("An error occurred during the upload:", error.message);
  }
}
```

### Fetching files

Fetch the files in a directory

#### Example: Fetch a list of files from Terabox

```javascript
async function fetchFileList() {
  try {
    const fileList = await uploader.fetchFileList("/myUploads"); //fetching files from 'myuplods' directory, default is '/' directory.
    console.log("Files in your directory:", fileList);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error fetching file list:", error.message);
  }
}
```

### Downloading a file

Download a file by it's fs_id aka fileId

```javascript
async function download(fileId) { // fs_id from fetched file information
  try {
    const res = await uploader.downloadFile(fileId);
    console.log(res);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Delete a file

Delete a list of files, provide an array of path of files to delete

```javascript
async function deleteList() {
  try {
    const deleteD = await uploader.deleteFiles([
      "/FliqloScr.zip",
      "/Consent Letter.docx",
    ]);
    console.log(deleteD);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching file list:", error.message);
  }
}
```

### Moving a file

Moves a file from one location to another with a new name.

```javascript
async function moveFile(){
  try{
    const moved = await uploader.moveFiles('/sample_960x540.mkv', '/uploads', 'sample.mkv') //old path, new path, new name
    console.log(moved);
  }catch(error){
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```
