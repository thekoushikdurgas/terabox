- **Maintains existing functionality** while adding persistent storage

#### Key Changes:
- Added CSV saving functionality to the extract button workflow
- Integrated with existing state management system
- Provides user feedback on CSV operations

### 2. New CSV Manager Tab (📊 CSV Manager)
A completely new tab that provides comprehensive CSV database management:

#### Database Statistics Dashboard:
- **Total Links**: Shows count of all stored links
- **Processed Count**: Tracks how many links have been processed
- **Pending Count**: Shows unprocessed links
- **Unique Domains**: Displays variety of TeraBox domains

#### Advanced Filtering & Search:
- **Status Filter**: Filter by "All", "Pending", or "Processed" 
- **Domain Filter**: Filter by specific TeraBox domains
- **Search Functionality**: Search by SURL or full link text
- **Real-time filtering** with instant results

#### Data Display:
- **Professional DataFrames** with custom column configurations
- **Truncated URLs** for better readability
- **Sortable and searchable** interface
- **Responsive column widths**

#### Bulk Actions:
- **📊 Get File Info for All Links**: Process all unprocessed links with RapidAPI
- **📥 Export Filtered Data**: Download filtered results as CSV
- **🗑️ Clear CSV Database**: Complete database reset with confirmation

#### Processing Results:
- **Success/Failure Metrics**: Clear statistics on processing results
- **Individual File Details**: Expandable cards for each processed file
- **Download & Open Actions**: Direct file access from results
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting for failed links

### 3. Enhanced CSV Functions
Added three new utility functions to handle CSV operations:

#### `save_links_to_csv(links, csv_path)`
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Only adds new links not already in CSV
- **Structured Data**: Creates proper CSV with ID, SURL, Domain, timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user feedback
- **Incremental IDs**: Maintains sequential ID numbering

#### `load_links_from_csv(csv_path)`
- **Safe Loading**: Handles missing files gracefully
- **UTF-8 Support**: Proper encoding for international characters
- **Dictionary Format**: Returns structured data for easy processing

#### `extract_terabox_links(text)` (Enhanced)
- **Multiple Patterns**: Supports all major TeraBox domain variations
- **Duplicate Removal**: Preserves order while removing duplicates
- **Case Insensitive**: Works with various text formats

## 📁 File Structure

### Modified Files:
- `pages/💳_RapidAPI_Mode.py`: Added CSV functionality and new tab

### CSV Database:
- `utils/terebox.csv`: Persistent storage for extracted links

### CSV Schema:
```csv
ID,Link,SURL,Domain,Extracted_At,Status,Processed
1,https://terabox.com/s/example,example,terabox.com,2025-09-19 13:20:00,Pending,No
```

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Text Processing
1. User pastes text containing TeraBox links in **Text Processor** tab
2. Clicks **🔍 Extract & Process Links** button
3. System extracts links and **automatically saves to CSV**
4. User sees confirmation and extracted links table

### Step 2: CSV Management
1. User switches to **📊 CSV Manager** tab
2. Views database statistics and all stored links
3. Can filter, search, and manage the link collection
4. Uses **📊 Get File Info for All Links** for bulk processing

### Step 3: Bulk Processing
1. System processes all unprocessed links via RapidAPI
2. Shows real-time progress and results
3. Provides download and direct link access
4. Updates processing status in CSV

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Visual Enhancements:
- **Consistent emoji icons** for easy navigation
- **Color-coded status indicators** (✅ ❌ ⏳)
- **Progress bars** for bulk operations
- **Balloons celebration** for successful operations
- **Professional metrics cards** with clear statistics

### Usability Features:
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive operations
- **Smart filtering** with multiple criteria
- **Export functionality** for data portability
- **Quick navigation** between related tabs
- **Real-time feedback** on all operations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Integration Points:
- **StateManager**: Used for clean state updates
- **RapidAPI Client**: Leverages existing API integration
- **Browser Utils**: Maintains compatibility with browser opening
- **Pandas**: Enhanced data display and manipulation

### Error Handling:
- **Graceful degradation** when CSV is missing or corrupted
- **User-friendly error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Fallback behaviors** for edge cases
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Duplicate prevention** to avoid unnecessary storage
- **Efficient filtering** with list comprehensions
- **Lazy loading** of CSV data
- **Background processing** indicators

## 🧪 Testing Results

### CSV Functionality Test:
- ✅ **Link Extraction**: Successfully extracts 4/4 test links
- ✅ **CSV Storage**: Properly saves with correct schema
- ✅ **Data Loading**: Accurately loads all stored data
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Correctly avoids duplicate entries
- ✅ **File Management**: Clean creation and cleanup

### Integration Test:
